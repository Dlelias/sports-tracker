# Sports Tracker


## Description
Sports tracker the application where sports fans can find, news, highlights, game scores, and horseracing information . Users have access to different sports, such as Soccer, Tennis Basketball, Ice Hockey, Volleyball, and Handball. An easy user friendly dashboard for fans to navigate as they search the latest on their favorite sports. 


Our motivation was to create a react application that would appeal to a sports fans. Utilizing react hooks and different components to render different sports data for our users . Our users can navigate to news articles or sports video highlights. They are also presented with a neat sports page layout. Our user authentication grants user access to see sports articles and highlight videos. 


- What problem does it solve?

We are using a few different APIs to fetch the data being displayed on the application. By building a full stack app and using react components the application back end functionality rendered the data from the api calls to the front end for our users to see and interact with. 
 


- What did you learn?

We learned how to use react for the front end and use node.js, express for the backend to create a fully functional single page application. Using SQL for our database we were able to create user authentication for the users to access the application information.  By using react router the user is presented with different pages,however it application not refreshed, creating a better user experience.

## React Hooks
The following React hooks were utilized:

- useState - used to record state changes of current value and updated value. This was used for the following features:

           1) To show loading icon before content loads on Home, Sports News, and Game Highlights webpages. webpages.
          
           2) To record when user is logged in or logged out.
           
           3) To make various API calls to load specific content on the Home, Sports News, and Game Highlights webpages.
           
           4) To load the sidebar containing links to Home, Logout, Sports News, and Game Highlights
           
- useEffect - used to eliminate side effect and print out data when webpage renders, mainly used for API calls. The following APIs utilized the useEffect hook:

           1) Sports Score Rapid API

           2) Horse Racing Rapid API

- useContext - used to gain access to global data and rerender webpages when the global data is changed. The following example was used in this project for useContext:

           1) Record when user logs in
           
           2) Record when user logs out and ensure user cannot see any webpages without logging in.

           3) Ensure that if user is logged in and refreshes, it will bring user back to the home page.
           
           4) If user is logged out and refreshes, the user will be redirected to the login page and is unable to see any webpage without logging in.

- useNavigate - used to navigate across different webpages. Mainly used to implement the following feature:

           1) If user is logged in or refreshes while logged in, useNavigate will automatically redirect to the homepage and if user logs out, user will be redirected to the login webpage.
