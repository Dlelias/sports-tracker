# Sports Tracker


## Description
Sports tracker the application where sports fans can find, news, highlights, game scores, and horseracing information . Users have access to different sports, such as Soccer, Tennis Basketball, Ice Hockey, Volleyball, and Handball. An easy user friendly dashboard for fans to navigate as they search the latest on their favorite sports. 


Our motivation was to create a react application that would appeal to a sports fans. Utilizing react hooks and different components to render different sports data for our users . Our users can navigate to news articles or sports video highlights. They are also presented with a neat sports page layout. Our user authentication grants user access to see sports articles and highlight videos. 


- What problem does it solve?

We are using a few different APIs to fetch the data being displayed on the application. By building a full stack app and using react components the application back end functionality rendered the data from the api calls to the front end for our users to see and interact with. 
 


- What did you learn?

We learned how to use react for the front end and use node.js, express for the backend to create a fully functional single page application. Using SQL for our database we were able to create user authentication for the users to access the application information.  By using react router the user is presented with different pages,however it application not refreshed, creating a better user experience.
